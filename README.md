 # ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone**. The goal is to predict whether the **first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket** will successfully land, which is critical for **cost-effective space missions**. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at around $62 million, much lower than traditional providers (~$165 million), primarily due to their reusable first-stage boosters. Accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful landing could help alternate space companies make competitive bids or evaluate the risk profile of launches.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this capstone project, we perform an end-to-end data science workflow:
- **Data Collection**: Retrieve and parse SpaceX launch data using SpaceX API and web scraping.
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**: Clean, normalize, and prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discover relationships between features and landing outcomes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features such as payload mass, orbit type, and launch site.
- **Modeling**: Apply various machine learning models to classify landing outcomes.
- **Evaluation**: Compare models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
